        Poetry (derived from the Greek poiesis, "making") is a form of
        literature that uses aesthetic and often rhythmic[1][2][3] qualities of
        language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke
        meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.
        Poetry has a long and varied history, evolving differentially across the
        globe.

        It dates back at least to prehistoric times with hunting poetry in
        Africa, and to panegyric and elegiac court poetry of the empires of the
        Nile, Niger, and Volta River valleys.[4] Some of the earliest written
        poetry in Africa occurs among the Pyramid Texts written during the 25th
        century BCE. The earliest surviving Western Asian epic poetry, the Epic
        of Gilgamesh, was written in Sumerian.
