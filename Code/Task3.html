            Poetry (derived from the Greek poiesis, "making") is a form of
        literature that uses aesthetic and often rhythmic[1][2][3] qualities of
        language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke
        meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.
        Poetry has a long and varied history, evolving differentially across the
        globe.
